# Optimizing-DataFrames-and-Processing-in-Chunks

In this project we will explore two very important strategies for handling large datasets and dealing with limited hardware resources:

* Optimizing Memory Footprint
* Processing the Data in Chunks

We'll be working with financial lending data from Lending Club, a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers with investors. The Lending Club's website lists approved loans. Qualified investors can view the borrower's credit score, the purpose of the loan, and other details in the loan applications. Once a lender is ready to back a loan, it selects the amount of money it wants to fund. When the loan amount the borrower requested is fully funded, the borrower receives the money, minus the origination fee that Lending Club charges.

We'll be working with a dataset of loans approved from 2007-2011 (https://bit.ly/3H2XVgC).
